# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code Challenge repository! ðŸš€

## Overview

This repository documents my coding journey during the #100daysofcodechallenge. Over the course of 100 days, I've dedicated myself to coding consistently, honing my skills, and working on a variety of coding projects. This journey has been an incredible learning experience, allowing me to explore new technologies, build exciting projects, and connect with the coding community.

## What's Inside

- **Daily Progress**: Each day of my challenge is documented with a corresponding directory, showcasing the code, projects, or activities I worked on during that day. It's an excellent way to see my progress and the diverse range of topics I've covered.

- **Learning Resources**: I've curated a list of valuable resources, tutorials, and books that have been instrumental in my learning journey. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced coder, you may find these resources helpful.

- **Challenges Faced**: It's important to acknowledge that coding isn't always smooth sailing. I've shared the challenges I encountered, along with the solutions I came up with. It's a great way to learn from my mistakes and problem-solving experiences.
